# Welcome 🎉

The Quran is the main holy book of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a direct revelation from God.

Muslims assert that the Quran is:
- The eternal, uncreated word of God
- [Perfect and free from error](/issues)
- [Containing prophecies and scientific knowledge beyond human capacity](/science)

Quran.sh was created to explore these claims and others made about the Quran and to see if they hold up to scrutiny.
