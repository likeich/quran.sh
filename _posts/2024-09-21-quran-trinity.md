title: "Misunderstanding the Trinity"

## Introduction

The Trinity is an essential and universal Christian doctrine which posits that God consists of three persons, the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit, who are distinct yet co-equal and co-eternal. The Trinity is formalized as early as the Council of Nicaea in AD 325, 200 years prior to the life of Muhammed. The Quran describes the Trinity multiple times as the belief that Allah, Jesus, and Mary are Gods. This is an inaccurate description of the Christian belief of the Trinity.

## The Argument

1. **Premise 1**: [The Quran is said to be the eternal, perfect word of God, who is all-knowing.]({{ site.baseurl }}/issues)
2. **Premise 2**: The Quran misrepresents and mistunderstands the Christian Doctrine of the Trinity.
3. **Conclusion**: The Quran is not the eternal, perfect word of God.

## Background

Surah 5:116-118 describes a conversation between Allah and Jesus (who is considered a prophet in Islam).

{% include verse.html surah="5" ayah="116-118" %}

In these ayah, the Quran is describing the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary. Christians do not believe this, and do not worship Mary.

{% include verse.html surah="5" ayah="72-75" %}

## How Muslims Respond + Counterarguments

1. *The ayah was meant for a group that DID worship Mary in Arabia*
    - A [small group of Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collyridianism) in Arabia may have worshipped Mary as a goddess, although their existence is debated. Their existence is irrelevant to refute this point, as the context of Surah 5:116 is a conversation at judgement day. There is no reason for Allah and Jesus to have a conversation on judgement day about a tiny, fringe group of heretical Christians that have not existed for over a millenia.
2. *These verses do not describe the Trinity*
    - Muslims will cast doubt on the ayah, saying that it does not describe the Trinity, and instead condemns idolatry. Surah 5:72-75 further strengthens the argument that the Quran is describing the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary by reiterating the claims of divinity. Surah 5:75 specifically refutes the belief that Jesus and Mary are Gods, saying that Mary was a 'woman of truth' and that both Jesus and Mary ate food. Surah 5:73 just before specifically refers to the Trinity, before going on to refute that Jesus and Mary are Gods. Surah 5, in multiple ayah, describes the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary while specifically refuting that Jesus and Mary are not Gods.
