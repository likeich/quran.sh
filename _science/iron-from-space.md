## Verse in Question

{% include verse.html surah="57" ayah="25" %}

## The Claim

The claim is that the Quran miraculously states that iron was sent from outer space, a fact that scientists only recently discovered. It is now known that iron on Earth came from meteorites and was delivered from stars that exploded billions of years ago. The phrase "sent down" is interpreted to mean that iron came from space, which proponents argue is something the people of the 7th century could not have known.

## The Rebuttal

### 1. **Misinterpretation of the Text**

The phrase "sent down" is used numerous times throughout the Quran in various contexts, referring to both tangible and intangible things. For example:

{% include verse.html surah="23" ayah="18" %}
{% include verse.html surah="39" ayah="6" %}
{% include verse.html surah="5" ayah="48" %}

These verses demonstrate that the expression "sent down" (wa anzalna) is commonly used to signify God's provision of resources, blessings, or guidance, rather than describing a literal descent from space. In this context, the reference to iron should be understood metaphorically, indicating that it is provided to humanity by God's will, rather than making a scientific claim about its cosmic origin.

### 2. **Lack of Scientific Basis**

While it is true that iron came from supernovae and meteorites brought it to Earth, this was not unknown to ancient civilizations. Early humans understood that meteoric iron existed and often used it to craft tools. The claim that this is a miraculous scientific insight ignores the fact that the process of meteors falling to Earth was observable to people long before the Quran. For example, the ancient Egyptians referred to meteoric iron as "iron from the sky."

### 3. **Historical Context**

Meteoritic iron has been used by civilizations for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians, for example, crafted objects out of meteoric iron, and the concept of iron "coming from the sky" was not foreign to them. Therefore, the claim that the Quran uniquely revealed this is not valid, as knowledge of meteoritic iron was already widespread.

### 4. **Selective Interpretation**

This verse is often highlighted while ignoring many other verses that use the same "sent down" phrase. For instance, rain, livestock, and even divine guidance are described as being "sent down" in the Quran. When these verses are taken into account, it becomes clear that the phrase refers to God's providence over humanity and is not meant to convey literal scientific information about where these things originated.

## Why This Claim Fails

The claim that the Quran predicted the cosmic origin of iron is weak, as the language used is metaphorical and common in the Quran for various materials and blessings. Furthermore, ancient peoples already had knowledge of meteoritic iron, which undermines the claim that this was a novel scientific revelation. The frequent use of "sent down" in the Quran across many contexts shows that it is more about divine provision than a literal cosmic event.

## Conclusion

The interpretation that the Quran foretold the origin of iron from outer space is based on selective reading and misinterpretation. Ancient civilizations already knew about meteoritic iron, and the Quranâ€™s usage of "sent down" is metaphorical, not scientific. This is another example of a "miracle" claim that doesn't hold up under scrutiny.
