## Verse in Question

{% include verse.html surah="21" ayah="30" %}

## The Claim

Proponents of scientific miracles in the Quran argue that this verse predicts the origin of life from water. They claim that the phrase "We made every living thing from water" is a miraculous scientific insight into the composition of living organisms. This interpretation is used to suggest that the Quran contains advanced knowledge about biology and the origins of life.

## Why This Claim Fails

The claim that the Quran miraculously describes life as originating from water is based on a misinterpretation of the text. While the Quran mentions water as essential for life, this idea was already widespread in ancient civilizations, including the Greeks, Egyptians, and Sumerians, who also viewed water as fundamental to life.

The verse likely reflects observable knowledge of water's importance, particularly in desert cultures, rather than a unique scientific revelation. Ancient peoples understood that water was vital for survival, and many creation myths emphasized water as the source of life. Therefore, the Quranâ€™s reference to water should be seen as part of this broader historical context, not a miraculous scientific insight.

The interpretation linking this verse to modern biology, particularly the composition of cells, is selective and overlooks the more probable theological meaning of water as a source of sustenance.
