### Summary

The Quran portrays the Torah and the Injeel (Gospel) as direct revelations from Allah, given to Moses and Jesus to guide their people with wisdom, light, and judgment. It highlights that the Torah was revealed to Moses after earlier generations were destroyed, serving as enlightenment and mercy for the Children of Israel (28:43, 32:23). Similarly, the Gospel was given to Jesus to confirm the Torah, containing guidance and light (3:50, 5:46). According to the Quran, both scriptures are part of Allah's divine plan to guide humanity through successive revelations (2:87, 5:110, 61:6), showing that Allah has continuously sent prophets and scriptures to different communities over time.

The Quran also suggests that these scriptures were entrusted to rabbis, scholars, and followers to preserve and follow (5:44, 5:66), but it criticizes those who failed to safeguard the message and neglected their responsibilities (2:101, 62:5). It emphasizes that the Quran serves as a confirmation of these earlier revelations, continuing the line of divine guidance (3:3, 46:12).
