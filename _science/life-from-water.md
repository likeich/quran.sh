## Verse in Question

{% include verse.html surah="21" ayah="30" %}

## The Claim

The claim associated with this verse is that the Quran miraculously describes a scientific fact unknown to people in 7th century Arabia: that life is fundamentally composed of water. Modern science confirms that cells are mostly made up of water, and this is considered evidence that the Quran is aligned with modern biology.

## The Rebuttal

### 1. **Misinterpretation of the Text**

This verse is interpreted as a scientific claim about the biological structure of life, but a more accurate understanding may suggest a metaphorical or theological meaning. It is common in ancient texts to reference water as the origin of life due to its observable importance in sustaining life, especially in desert cultures. The Quran’s mention of water here may not be making a novel scientific claim, but rather reflecting widely held beliefs about the necessity of water.

### 2. **Lack of Scientific Basis**

While modern science recognizes that cells are mostly composed of water, this knowledge existed in various forms long before the Quran. Ancient civilizations, including the Greeks and Egyptians, also believed in water as the primary element of life. The claim that life originating from water is a "scientific miracle" ignores the fact that this knowledge was likely influenced by observable phenomena, like rivers and rain sustaining life in desert environments.

### 3. **Historical Context**

The idea that life originates from water was not unique to the Quran. Many ancient cultures, such as the Sumerians, Greeks, and Egyptians, had myths and philosophies that included water as a fundamental source of life. These ideas were known and passed down through generations, making it unsurprising that similar ideas appear in the Quran.

### 4. **Selective Interpretation**

The interpretation that links this verse to modern scientific discoveries about cell biology is selective. Other verses in the Quran that discuss water are rarely brought up in these discussions, and the theological meaning of water as sustenance for life is often overlooked in favor of a scientific interpretation.

## Why This Claim Fails

This claim does not hold up because the knowledge that water is essential for life was already widely recognized long before the Quran. The verse likely reflects common understandings of the time rather than providing miraculous foresight into the nature of cellular biology.

## Conclusion

This verse about life originating from water is often misinterpreted as evidence of the Quran’s alignment with modern science. However, upon closer scrutiny, the claim fails due to a combination of historical context, misinterpretation of the text, and lack of scientific uniqueness.
