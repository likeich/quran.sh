## Verse in Question

{% include verse.html surah="51" ayah="47" %}

## The Claim

Proponents of scientific miracles in the Quran argue that this verse refers to the expanding universe. They claim that the Arabic word "musi'un" in this verse means "expanding" and that this description aligns with modern cosmological theories about the universe's expansion. This interpretation is used to suggest that the Quran contains advanced scientific knowledge about the cosmos.

## Why This Claim Fails

The claim that chapter 51, verse 47 of the Quran refers to the expanding universe is based on a misinterpretation of the text. The Quranic term "expanding" refers to the sky or the heavens above, not the universe as we understand it today. This is a common retrofitting of modern scientific knowledge onto ancient texts.

1. **The Meaning of "Musi'un":**
   The Arabic word "musi'un" can be translated as "vast" or "expanding," but the context in which this term is used in the Quran refers to the creation of the sky, not the entire universe. The term is often used to describe vastness, and while it may suggest an expansive sky, it doesn't directly correlate with the scientific concept of the universe's expansion, which refers to space itself growing larger.

2. **Historical and Cultural Context:**
   At the time of the Quran’s revelation, many cultures, including the pre-Islamic Arabs, described the sky as vast or expansive based on observations of the natural world. These descriptions were not grounded in a scientific understanding of cosmology but were rather based on visual perceptions of the sky. This is evidenced by similar notions found in other ancient texts, such as the Bible's descriptions of the heavens in the Book of Genesis (1:1-8), where the sky is created and described as a "firmament."

3. **Modern Science and the Universe’s Expansion:**
   The expansion of the universe was not scientifically confirmed until the 20th century when Edwin Hubble’s observations showed that galaxies are moving away from each other, indicating that the universe is expanding. This discovery was based on the redshift of light from distant galaxies, a phenomenon that could not have been understood during the 7th century. The claim that the Quran predicted this expansion is therefore a retroactive interpretation, reading modern science into an ancient text without sufficient historical or linguistic basis.

## Scholar Opinions

Scholars of Quranic interpretation have varied opinions on whether these verses refer to scientific phenomena. For example:

- **Tafsir Ibn Kathir:** Ibn Kathir, a classical Islamic scholar, interprets Surah 51:47 as a reference to Allah’s power in creating the vastness of the sky. He makes no mention of a scientific understanding of the expanding universe, emphasizing the majesty of creation instead.

- **Mufti Muhammad Shafi (Ma’ariful Quran):** In his tafsir, Mufti Shafi also mentions the term "expanding" in a metaphorical sense, referring to the vastness of the skies, not a literal expansion of the universe as cosmologists understand it today.
