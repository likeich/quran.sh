[Muslims believe](/issues/one-mistake) that the Quran is a direct, final revelation from God which is perfectly preserved and free from error. A single error found in the Quran disproves the entire religion because it would mean that 1. The Quran is not preserved, and therefore is false (Surah 41, Ayah 42) or 2. God made mistakes. When reading the articles below, keep in mind that if a single article is true, then Islam is false.
