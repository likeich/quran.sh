title: "The Expanding Universe"
description: "Does the Quran describe the expanding universe?"
surah: 51

claim: Proponents of scientific miracles in the Quran argue that this verse refers to the expanding universe. They claim that the Arabic word "musi'un" in this verse means "expanding" and that this description aligns with modern cosmological theories about the universe's expansion. This interpretation is used to suggest that the Quran contains advanced scientific knowledge about the cosmos.
