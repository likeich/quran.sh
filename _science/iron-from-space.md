title: "Iron Sent from Outer Space"
description: "Does the Quran predict that iron was sent down from space?"
surah: 57
ayah: 25
claim: Proponents of scientific miracles in the Quran argue that this verse predicts the extraterrestrial origin of iron. They claim that the phrase "sent down" refers to iron being brought to Earth from space, specifically through meteorites. This interpretation is used to suggest that the Quran contains advanced scientific knowledge about the origins of materials on Earth.
