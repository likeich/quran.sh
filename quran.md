The Quran is the major religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God, delivered to the Prophet Muhammad over a period of approximately 23 years. It is written in classical Arabic and is regarded as the literal word of God (Allah) by Muslims. The Quran consists of 114 chapters, or surahs, which are further divided into verses, or ayahs. These surahs vary in length and cover various topics, including theology, morality, guidance for personal conduct, law, and narratives of earlier prophets.

The Quran is recited, memorized, and studied by millions of Muslims worldwide. Its recitation holds great significance in Muslim worship, especially during the month of Ramadan, when it is traditionally read in its entirety in special prayers called Tarawih. The Quran is also a source of legal and moral guidance, shaping the spiritual and ethical framework of Muslim communities.

# What are the Claims About the Quran?

There are several claims about the Quran that are central to Islamic belief:

### 1. Divine Revelation
Muslims believe that the Quran is the final revelation from God to humanity, following earlier revelations such as the Torah and the Gospel. Unlike previous scriptures, the Quran is seen as the unaltered and complete message from God, preserved in its original form since its revelation. Muslims believe that the Quran was transmitted to Prophet Muhammad by the Angel Gabriel and that it serves as guidance for all aspects of life.

### 2. Miraculous Nature
Many Muslims believe that the Quran is a linguistic and literary miracle, unmatched in its eloquence, depth, and structure. It is often cited that the Quranâ€™s composition is beyond human capability, and it challenges skeptics to produce even a single chapter comparable to its content (Surah 2:23). The belief in the miraculous nature of the Quran extends beyond its literary qualities to include its message, consistency, and relevance across time.

### 3. Inerrancy and Preservation
Muslims claim that the Quran is free from any errors or contradictions and that it has remained unchanged since its revelation. This claim of inerrancy is closely tied to the belief that the Quran is the direct word of God, making it infallible. Muslims also believe that the Quran has been preserved in its original form through careful memorization and transcription, a process that started during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad and continued after his death.

### 4. Universal Guidance
The Quran is considered a comprehensive guide for all of humanity, not just for Muslims. Its teachings encompass every aspect of life, including personal behavior, family relations, social justice, and governance. The Quran emphasizes monotheism, the importance of righteous conduct, and accountability in the afterlife, and provides a framework for worship and spiritual growth.

### 5. Scientific Knowledge
Some Muslims claim that the Quran contains knowledge of natural phenomena that was not known at the time of its revelation. These include descriptions of embryonic development, astronomy, and the water cycle, which modern science has only recently understood. This has led to the belief that the Quran is not only a spiritual guide but also contains scientific truths that validate its divine origin.

### 6. Consistency with Previous Scriptures
Muslims believe that the Quran confirms and clarifies the messages brought by earlier prophets, such as Moses, David, and Jesus. It is considered the final and complete version of God's guidance, superseding previous scriptures, which Muslims believe were altered or misinterpreted over time.

In conclusion, the Quran holds a central place in Islamic faith and practice. Its claims of divine origin, linguistic perfection, and timeless guidance shape the beliefs and actions of Muslims worldwide. The Quran's influence extends beyond religious practice to law, society, and culture, making it one of the most significant texts in human history.
