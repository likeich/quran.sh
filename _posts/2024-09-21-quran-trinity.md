title: "Misunderstanding the Trinity"
categories: quran-issues
---

## Introduction

The Trinity is an essential and universal Christian doctrine which posits that God consists of three persons, the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit, who are distinct yet co-equal and co-eternal. The Trinity is formalized as early as the Council of Nicaea in AD 325, 200 years prior to the life of Muhammed. The Quran describes the Trinity multiple times as the belief that Allah, Jesus, and Mary are Gods. This is an inaccurate description of the Christian belief of the Trinity.

## The Argument

1. **Premise 1**: The Quran is the eternal, perfect word of God, who is all-knowing.
2. **Premise 2**: The Quran misrepresents the Christian Doctrine of the Trinity.
3. **Conclusion**: The Quran is not the eternal, perfect word of God.

## Background

Surah 5:116-118 describes a conversation between Allah and Jesus (who is considered a prophet in Islam).
