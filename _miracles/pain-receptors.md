title: "Pain Receptors in the Skin"
description: "Does the Quran predict the presence of pain receptors in the skin?"
refutation: "Surah 4:56 does not miraculously predict the modern discovery of pain receptors in the skin. The verse speaks about punishment in hell, metaphorically describing repeated burning to intensify suffering. The idea that the skin feels pain was common knowledge in ancient times—no miracle required."
surah: 4
ayah: 56
claim: Proponents of scientific miracles in the Quran argue that this verse predicts the discovery of pain receptors in the skin. They claim that the Quran’s description of burning and skin replacement reflects modern understanding of nerve endings and pain perception in the skin, showing advanced scientific knowledge.

  - label: "context"
    value: false
    description: "The verse uses metaphorical language about punishment in the afterlife, not a scientific description of skin functions. The context is spiritual and moral, not anatomical."
  - label: "timeliness"
    value: false
    description: "It was common knowledge in ancient civilizations that skin is sensitive to pain, especially when burned. The Quran’s mention of burning and skin would not have been groundbreaking or unknown at the time."

    description: "The verse does not specify the existence of pain receptors, nor does it provide a detailed description of their function. This claim of scientific foresight is not explicitly supported by the text."

The Quran uses metaphorical language to describe the experience of punishment in the afterlife. The concept of pain through the skin, especially due to burning, was already known to ancient civilizations and does not reflect specific scientific foresight.
