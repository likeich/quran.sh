## Verse in Question

{% include verse.html surah="57" ayah="25" %}

## The Claim

Proponents of scientific miracles in the Quran argue that this verse predicts the extraterrestrial origin of iron. They claim that the phrase "sent down" refers to iron being brought to Earth from space, specifically through meteorites. This interpretation is used to suggest that the Quran contains advanced scientific knowledge about the origins of materials on Earth.

## Why This Claim Fails

The claim that the Quran predicts iron was "sent down" from space is based on a misinterpretation of the phrase. In the Quran, "sent down" is used in various contexts to signify God's provision, not a literal descent from space. It refers to both physical items like rain and abstract concepts like divine guidance. The same phrase is used for many blessings, including water and cattle, making it a common metaphor rather than a scientific insight.

While it is true that iron on Earth came from meteorites, ancient civilizations already knew about meteoritic iron. For example, the Egyptians referred to it as "iron from the sky" and used it to craft tools. The idea that iron came from space was not a revelation unique to the Quran, but rather common knowledge observed by people of the time.

The frequent use of "sent down" in the Quran shows that it refers to God's control over creation, not a literal explanation of the origins of materials. This selective interpretation ignores other similar verses, weakening the argument for a miraculous scientific prediction.
