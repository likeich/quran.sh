title: "Life Originating from Water"
description: "Does the Quran predict that all living things are made from water?"
surah: 21
ayah: 30
claim: Proponents of scientific miracles in the Quran argue that this verse predicts the origin of life from water. They claim that the phrase "We made every living thing from water" is a miraculous scientific insight into the composition of living organisms. This interpretation is used to suggest that the Quran contains advanced knowledge about biology and the origins of life.
facts:
  - label: "falsifiability"
    value: false
    description: "This is difficult to falsify because the verse does not provide a specific scientific mechanism for the origin of life. It simply mentions water's importance and is not specific enough to be tested or disproven"
  - label: "accuracy"
    value: false
    description: "The claim that all living things are made 'from water' is not entirely accurate. Living organisms are composed of a variety of elements and compounds. The interpretation that evolution proves life came from water also contradicts the Quran which states that Allah created humans from clay (Surah 15:26-29)"
  - label: "context"
    value: false
    description: "Many ancient cultures and creation myths, including those of the Greeks and Sumerians, emphasized water as a source of life."
  - label: "timeliness"
    value: false
    description: "The understanding that water is essential for life was already well-known in ancient times, long before the Quran was written. Further, the importance of water would be especially evident in the Arabian Peninsula where it is scarce."
  - label: "specificity"
    value: false
    description: "It does not describe the molecular structure of cells, the role of water in biological processes, or any details that align with modern biology. The interpretation that links it to modern scientific discoveries is selective and allows for reinterpretation"
