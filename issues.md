Given the Quran’s claim of divine authorship, infallibility, and perfect preservation, any error—whether factual, historical, or linguistic—is catastrophic to its credibility. The Quran challenges readers to reflect on the text to find contradictions, explicitly stating that if any are found, it would disprove the Quran's divine origin.

### One Mistake Invalidates the Quran

The Quran is built upon the premise that it is flawless. As seen in Surah 4:82, the Quran acknowledges that if contradictions were found, they would indicate a human, rather than divine, origin. Since divine revelation, by definition, cannot contain errors, even a single mistake would call into question the entire foundation of the Islamic faith.

- If the Quran claims perfect preservation, yet historical evidence suggests textual alterations, this would undermine the Quran’s reliability.
- If scientific inaccuracies or historical errors are identified, they would challenge the Quran's claim of being free from error.

Thus, the claim is that the Quran must be wholly accurate and preserved, or it cannot be regarded as the infallible word of God.

## Conclusion

The Quran makes extraordinary claims about its divine origin, preservation, and infallibility. Any mistake, contradiction, or inconsistency within the text would not merely be a minor issue but would fundamentally invalidate the Quran’s status as the word of God. This leaves the text open to scrutiny, with the understanding that proving even one error would have profound theological implications.
