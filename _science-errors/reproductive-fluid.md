title: "Where Semen Comes From"
description: "Does the Quran claim that male reproductive fluid originates from between the backbone and the ribs?"
refutation: "The Quran claims that semen comes from between the backbone and ribs. We know today that semen is produced in the testes, not in that area. All major translations of the verse reflect this error, and it’s meant to be taken literally. This clear contradiction with modern biology shows the Quran’s description of human reproduction is inaccurate."
surah: 86
ayah: 5-7
contradicts: The Quran claims that semen originates from between the backbone and the ribs. This is a clear contradiction with modern science, which has shown that semen is produced in the testes.
accuracy: The translation is accurate. [All English translations](https://quran.com/86/5-7?translations=20%2C95%2C85%2C131%2C84%2C19%2C22%2C203%2C57) of the verses on Quran.com state that the fluid originates from between the backbone and the ribs, or between the loins, and chest-bones.
literal: The context verse, and the other verses discussing the fluid that man is created from are all presented as if they are literal.
regularity: The original creation of man from clay is considered a miracle that displays the power of Allah. Afterwards, the continued creation of man from a fluid is considered the normative and regular occurence.

### Context

The Quran describes the creation of human beings from a drop of fluid in a number of verses, listed below. Each of the verses describes the creation of man in a different context.

Describing the physical development of the human being:
{% include verse.html surah="23" ayah="12-14" %}

Describing the majesty of God's creation:
{% include verse.html surah="32" ayah="7-9" %}

All verses reiterate the original creation of man from clay, and his descendants from a drop of fluid.

Sura 86:5-7, above, finally describes the source of the liquid later in the Quran.
