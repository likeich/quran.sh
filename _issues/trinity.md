title: "Misunderstanding the Trinity"
description: "The Quran describes the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary, which is not the Christian belief."
tldr: |
  1. The Quran describes the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary, which is not the Christian belief.
  2. The Trinity is the essential doctrine of Christianity, and the Quran's misrepresentation of it is a significant error.
  3. The Quran does not, in a single instance, describe the Christian doctrine of the Trinity correctly as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
  4. Early commentaries on the Quran interpret these verses as describing the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary.
intro: |
  The Trinity is an essential and universal Christian doctrine which posits that God consists of three persons, the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit, who are distinct yet co-equal and co-eternal. The Trinity is formalized as early as the Council of Nicaea in AD 325, 200 years prior to the life of Muhammed. The Quran describes the Trinity multiple times as the belief that Allah, Jesus, and Mary are Gods. This is an inaccurate description of the Christian belief of the Trinity.

  2. **Premise 2**: The Quran contains misrepresentations or falsehoods of the Christian Doctrine of the Trinity.
  3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the Quran is not the eternal, perfect word of God.

## Background

Surah 5:116-118 describes a conversation between Allah and Jesus (who is considered a prophet in Islam).

{% include verse.html surah="5" ayah="116-118" %}

In these verses, the Quran is describing the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary. Christians do not believe this, and do not worship Mary.

{% include verse.html surah="5" ayah="72-75" %}

The Trinity is THE essential doctrine of Christianity and makes it distinct from any other religion. It is important to note that these verses are the ONLY ones in the Quran that mention the Trinity whatsoever. The Quran does not, in a single example, describe the Christian doctrine of the Trinity correctly as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

The author the Quran *again* in Surah 4:171 describes the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary:

{% include verse.html surah="4" ayah="171" %}

Lastly, [multiple early commentaries](https://carm.org/islam/did-the-author-of-the-quran-understand-the-trinity/) on these passages from Ibn Ishaq, Muqātil ibn Sulaymān, and other all interpret these verses as describing the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary.

## How Muslims Respond + Counterarguments

### *The verses were meant for a group that DID worship Mary in Arabia*
  - A [small group of Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collyridianism) in Arabia may have worshipped Mary as a goddess, although their existence is debated. Their existence is irrelevant to refute this point, as the context of Surah 5:116 is a conversation at judgement day. There is no reason for Allah and Jesus to have a conversation on judgement day about a tiny, fringe group of heretical Christians that have not existed for over a millenia.

  - Muslims believe that Christians commit shirk (associating others with Allah) by believing that God is a Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 2 billion Christians today, in the mind of Muslims, are committing one of the worst sins possible by believing in the Trinity. It is illogical that Allah and Jesus at the end of time would be discussing a potentially non-existent group of heretical Christians in ancient Arabia while ignoring billions of Christians worldwide committing shirk to this day.

### *These verses do not describe the Trinity*
  - Muslims will cast doubt on the verses, saying that it does not describe the Trinity, and instead condemns idolatry. Surah 5:72-75 further strengthens the argument that the Quran is describing the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary by reiterating the claims of divinity. Surah 5:75 specifically refutes the belief that Jesus and Mary are Gods, saying that Mary was a 'woman of truth' and that both Jesus and Mary ate food. Surah 5:73 just before specifically refers to the Trinity, before going on to refute that Jesus and Mary are Gods. Surah 5, in multiple verses, describes the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary while specifically refuting that Jesus and Mary are not Gods.

  - As stated before, early commentaries on the Quran interpret these verses as describing the Trinity as Allah, Jesus, and Mary. Only modern Muslims reinterpret these verses to mean anything else.
